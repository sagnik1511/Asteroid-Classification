<h1>GOALS of the Project</h1>
This project focuses on earth's vulnerabilities on asteroids.
Every day hundreds even thousands of meteorite hit earth,
so analyzing the bigger ones (asteroids) will let us understand the vulnerability towards other spatial objects.
The secondary goal of the project is to implement cutting edge mlops to actual real problems.

# Data Collection Process :

The data comprises of several entries on several days on NASA JPL, USA.
All the data apis are fully functional and can be used for data gathering straight from them.
Personally the data is taken from a kaggle dataset , Link : [kaggle/nasa-asteroid-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/nasa-asteroids-classification)
. The data is actually stored in json format.

### Special Note : 
Data has been stored using **DVC(Data version Control)**, so the repository package can be 
used flexibly without adding the data straight in the repo but fetch from any remote source e.g. **AWS S3**, **GDRIVE**, etc.
For this case, the data has been stored in GDRIVE.


# Directory Structure :

The data follows a strict data science project structure.
